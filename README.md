# cmake-demo

A repo that has some small `CMake` projects to demonstrate how it can be utilized.
`CMake` is a handy open source tool that defines the structure of a project.
It can be used for all sorts of purposes and is especially useful for cross-platform development.
It works well for people who prefer command-line builds but a wide range of IDEs also have support for CMake.

This repo contains some demos for some of the useful things that `CMake` can do.
